# AR-3dtris Privacy Policy

This application uses the camera for augmented reality purposes only.
The camera image is not recorded, shared nor sent anywhere. The application
does not show ads nor record or process any personally identifiable
information about the user.

THIS SECTION IS WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS TO MAKE THIS MORE LIKELY TO PASS FOR A
LEGAL DOCUMENT. IF YOU (hereafter, "You") ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA, I (hereafter "Me", "I" or "Otto") THINK YOU MAY BE ALLOWED SUE
ME IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE GAME OR THIS DOCUMENT.

Otherwise I would not have written this, but Google required me to do it
to submit the app to Play Store.

TL;DR this app does not track you nor record the camera. It's just a game,
like in the '90s.
